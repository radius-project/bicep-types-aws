Instead, use Fn::GetAtt Script.Arn or Fn::GetAtt Script.Id to retrieve either of these properties as input for ScriptId. Alternatively, enter a ScriptId string manually.
* **ServerLaunchParameters**: string: This parameter is no longer used but is retained for backward compatibility. Instead, specify server launch parameters in the RuntimeConfiguration parameter. A request must specify either a runtime configuration or values for both ServerLaunchParameters and ServerLaunchPath.
