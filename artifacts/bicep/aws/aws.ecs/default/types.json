For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that's the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task is guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed. Moreover, each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it. If both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units.\n On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see [CPU share constraint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cpu-share-constraint) in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter isn't required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:\n  +   *Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0:* Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares.\n  +   *Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0:* Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.\n  \n On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit, or a quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU that's described in the task definition. A null or zero CPU value is passed to Docker as ``0``, which Windows interprets as 1% of one CPU."

For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Linux instances, any network mode can be used. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Windows instances, ``<default>`` or ``awsvpc`` can be used. If the network mode is set to ``none``, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The ``host`` and ``awsvpc`` network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the ``bridge`` mode.\n With the ``host`` and ``awsvpc`` network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the ``host`` network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the ``awsvpc`` network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings. \n  When using the ``host`` network mode, you should not run containers using the root user (UID 0).
