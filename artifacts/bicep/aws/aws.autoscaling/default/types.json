This strategy has the lowest risk of interruption. To give certain instance types a higher chance of launching first, use capacity-optimized-prioritized. + capacity-optimized-prioritized You set the order of instance types for the launch template overrides from highest to lowest priority (from first to last in the list). Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling honors the instance type priorities on a best effort basis but optimizes for capacity first. Note that if the On-Demand allocation strategy is set to prioritized, the same priority is applied when fulfilling On-Demand capacity. This is not a valid value for Auto Scaling groups that specify InstanceRequirements. + lowest-price Requests Spot Instances using the lowest priced pools within an Availability Zone, across the number of Spot pools that you specify for the SpotInstancePools property. To ensure that your desired capacity is met, you might receive Spot Instances from several pools. This is the default value, but it might lead to high interruption rates because this strategy only considers instance price and not available capacity. + price-capacity-optimized (recommended) The price and capacity optimized allocation strategy looks at both price and capacity to select the Spot Instance pools that are the least likely to be interrupted and have the lowest possible price."
