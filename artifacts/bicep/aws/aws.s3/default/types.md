* **AccessControlTranslation**: [AccessControlTranslation](#accesscontroltranslation): Specify this only in a cross-account scenario (where source and destination bucket owners are not the same), and you want to change replica ownership to the AWS-account that owns the destination bucket. If this is not specified in the replication configuration, the replicas are owned by same AWS-account that owns the source object.
* **Account**: string: Destination bucket owner account ID. In a cross-account scenario, if you direct Amazon S3 to change replica ownership to the AWS-account that owns the destination bucket by specifying the ``AccessControlTranslation`` property, this is the account ID of the destination bucket owner.

## ReplicationRule
### Properties
* **DeleteMarkerReplication**: [DeleteMarkerReplication](#deletemarkerreplication): Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If you specify a ``Filter`` in your replication configuration, you must also include a ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` element. If your ``Filter`` includes a ``Tag`` element, the ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` ``Status`` must be set to Disabled, because Amazon S3 does not support replicating delete markers for tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see [Basic Rule Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-config-min-rule-config). 
 For more information about delete marker replication, see [Basic Rule Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/delete-marker-replication.html). 
  If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see [Backward Compatibility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations).

This field isn't supported in a V1 replication configuration.
  V1 replication configuration only supports filtering by key prefix. To filter using a V1 replication configuration, add the ``Prefix`` directly as a child element of the ``Rule`` element.
* **Id**: string: A unique identifier for the rule. The maximum value is 255 characters. If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation generates a random ID. When using a V2 replication configuration this property is capitalized as "ID".
* **Prefix**: string: An object key name prefix that identifies the object or objects to which the rule applies. The maximum prefix length is 1,024 characters. To include all objects in a bucket, specify an empty string. To filter using a V1 replication configuration, add the ``Prefix`` directly as a child element of the ``Rule`` element.
  Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see [XML related object key constraints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints).
* **Priority**: int: The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever two or more replication rules conflict. Amazon S3 will attempt to replicate objects according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or more rules with the same destination bucket, then objects will be replicated according to the rule with the highest priority. The higher the number, the higher the priority. 
 For more information, see [Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  +  If you specify both a ``Prefix`` and a ``TagFilter``, wrap these filters in an ``And`` tag.
  +  If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap the ``TagFilter`` elements in an ``And`` tag.
* **Prefix**: string: An object key name prefix that identifies the subset of objects to which the rule applies.
  Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see [XML related object key constraints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints).

If request is for pages in the ``/docs`` folder, redirect to the ``/documents`` folder. 2. If request results in HTTP error 4xx, redirect request to another host where you might process the error.

## RoutingRuleCondition
### Properties
* **HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals**: string: The HTTP error code when the redirect is applied. In the event of an error, if the error code equals this value, then the specified redirect is applied.
 Required when parent element ``Condition`` is specified and sibling ``KeyPrefixEquals`` is not specified. If both are specified, then both must be true for the redirect to be applied.
* **KeyPrefixEquals**: string: The object key name prefix when the redirect is applied. For example, to redirect requests for ``ExamplePage.html``, the key prefix will be ``ExamplePage.html``. To redirect request for all pages with the prefix ``docs/``, the key prefix will be ``/docs``, which identifies all objects in the docs/ folder.
 Required when the parent element ``Condition`` is specified and sibling ``HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals`` is not specified. If both conditions are specified, both must be true for the redirect to be applied.

* **NoncurrentVersionExpiration**: [NoncurrentVersionExpiration](#noncurrentversionexpiration): Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon expiration, S3 permanently deletes the noncurrent object versions. You set this lifecycle configuration action on a bucket that has versioning enabled (or suspended) to request that S3 delete noncurrent object versions at a specific period in the object's lifetime.
* **NoncurrentVersionExpirationInDays**: int: (Deprecated.) For buckets with versioning enabled (or suspended), specifies the time, in days, between when a new version of the object is uploaded to the bucket and when old versions of the object expire. When object versions expire, Amazon S3 permanently deletes them. If you specify a transition and expiration time, the expiration time must be later than the transition time.
* **NoncurrentVersionTransition**: [NoncurrentVersionTransition](#noncurrentversiontransition): (Deprecated.) For buckets with versioning enabled (or suspended), specifies when non-current objects transition to a specified storage class.
