## StepAdjustment
### Properties
* **MetricIntervalLowerBound**: int: The lower bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric. If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the lower bound is inclusive (the metric must be greater than or equal to the threshold plus the lower bound). Otherwise, it is exclusive (the metric must be greater than the threshold plus the lower bound). A null value indicates negative infinity.
* **MetricIntervalUpperBound**: int: The upper bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric. If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the upper bound is exclusive (the metric must be less than the threshold plus the upper bound). Otherwise, it is inclusive (the metric must be less than or equal to the threshold plus the upper bound). A null value indicates positive infinity.
* **ScalingAdjustment**: int (Required): The amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjustment type. A positive value adds to the current capacity while a negative number removes from the current capacity. For exact capacity, you must specify a positive value.

## StepScalingPolicyConfiguration

* **Cooldown**: int: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a previous scaling activity to take effect.
* **MetricAggregationType**: string: The aggregation type for the CloudWatch metrics. Valid values are Minimum, Maximum, and Average. If the aggregation type is null, the value is treated as Average
* **MinAdjustmentMagnitude**: int: The minimum value to scale by when the adjustment type is PercentChangeInCapacity.

* **Id**: string: A short name that identifies the object's results in the response.
* **Label**: string: A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is a math expression, so that you know what the value represents.
* **MetricStat**: [TargetTrackingMetricStat](#targettrackingmetricstat): Information about the metric data to return.
* **ReturnData**: bool: Indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric.

## TargetTrackingMetricDimension

* **Unit**: string: The unit to use for the returned data points.

## TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration
### Properties
* **CustomizedMetricSpecification**: [CustomizedMetricSpecification](#customizedmetricspecification): A customized metric. You can specify either a predefined metric or a customized metric.
* **DisableScaleIn**: bool: Indicates whether scale in by the target tracking scaling policy is disabled. If the value is true, scale in is disabled and the target tracking scaling policy won't remove capacity from the scalable target. Otherwise, scale in is enabled and the target tracking scaling policy can remove capacity from the scalable target. The default value is false.
* **PredefinedMetricSpecification**: [PredefinedMetricSpecification](#predefinedmetricspecification): A predefined metric. You can specify either a predefined metric or a customized metric.
* **ScaleInCooldown**: int: The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale-in activity completes before another scale-in activity can start.
* **ScaleOutCooldown**: int: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a previous scale-out activity to take effect.
* **TargetValue**: int (Required): The target value for the metric. Although this property accepts numbers of type Double, it won't accept values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of -2^360 to 2^360. The value must be a valid number based on the choice of metric. For example, if the metric is CPU utilization, then the target value is a percent value that represents how much of the CPU can be used before scaling out.
