The possible values are ``append``, ``preserve``, and ``remove``. The default is ``append``.
  +  If the value is ``append``, the Application Load Balancer adds the client IP address (of the last hop) to the ``X-Forwarded-For`` header in the HTTP request before it sends it to targets.
  +  If the value is ``preserve`` the Application Load Balancer preserves the ``X-Forwarded-For`` header in the HTTP request, and sends it to targets without any change.
  +  If the value is ``remove``, the Application Load Balancer removes the ``X-Forwarded-For`` header in the HTTP request before it sends it to targets.
  
  +   ``routing.http2.enabled`` - Indicates whether HTTP/2 is enabled. The possible values are ``true`` and ``false``. The default is ``true``. Elastic Load Balancing requires that message header names contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens.
