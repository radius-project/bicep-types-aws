* **DBParameterGroupName**: string: The name of an existing DB parameter group or a reference to an [AWS::RDS::DBParameterGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-dbparametergroup.html) resource created in the template.
 To list all of the available DB parameter group names, use the following command:
  ``aws rds describe-db-parameter-groups --query "DBParameterGroups[].DBParameterGroupName" --output text`` 
  If any of the data members of the referenced parameter group are changed during an update, the DB instance might need to be restarted, which causes some interruption. If the parameter group contains static parameters, whether they were changed or not, an update triggers a reboot.
  If you don't specify a value for ``DBParameterGroupName`` property, the default DB parameter group for the specified engine and engine version is used.
* **DBSecurityGroups**: string[]: A list of the DB security groups to assign to the DB instance. The list can include both the name of existing DB security groups or references to AWS::RDS::DBSecurityGroup resources created in the template.
  If you set DBSecurityGroups, you must not set VPCSecurityGroups, and vice versa. Also, note that the DBSecurityGroups property exists only for backwards compatibility with older regions and is no longer recommended for providing security information to an RDS DB instance. Instead, use VPCSecurityGroups.
  If you specify this property, AWS CloudFormation sends only the following properties (if specified) to Amazon RDS during create operations:
  +   ``AllocatedStorage`` 
  +   ``AutoMinorVersionUpgrade`` 
  +   ``AvailabilityZone`` 
  +   ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` 
  +   ``CharacterSetName`` 
  +   ``DBInstanceClass`` 
  +   ``DBName`` 
  +   ``DBParameterGroupName`` 
  +   ``DBSecurityGroups`` 
  +   ``DBSubnetGroupName`` 
  +   ``Engine`` 
  +   ``EngineVersion`` 
  +   ``Iops`` 
  +   ``LicenseModel`` 
  +   ``MasterUsername`` 
  +   ``MasterUserPassword`` 
  +   ``MultiAZ`` 
  +   ``OptionGroupName`` 
  +   ``PreferredBackupWindow`` 
  +   ``PreferredMaintenanceWindow`` 
  
 All other properties are ignored. Specify a virtual private cloud (VPC) security group if you want to submit other properties, such as ``StorageType``, ``StorageEncrypted``, or ``KmsKeyId``. If you're already using the ``DBSecurityGroups`` property, you can't use these other properties by updating your DB instance to use a VPC security group. You must recreate the DB instance.
* **DBSnapshotIdentifier**: string (WriteOnly): The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DB snapshot that's used to restore the DB instance. If you're restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, you must specify the ARN of the snapshot.
 By specifying this property, you can create a DB instance from the specified DB snapshot. If the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property is an empty string or the ``AWS::RDS::DBInstance`` declaration has no ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, AWS CloudFormation creates a new database. If the property contains a value (other than an empty string), AWS CloudFormation creates a database from the specified snapshot. If a snapshot with the specified name doesn't exist, AWS CloudFormation can't create the database and it rolls back the stack.
 Some DB instance properties aren't valid when you restore from a snapshot, such as the ``MasterUsername`` and ``MasterUserPassword`` properties. For information about the properties that you can specify, see the ``RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot`` action in the *Amazon RDS API Reference*.
 After you restore a DB instance with a ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, you must specify the same ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property for any future updates to the DB instance. When you specify this property for an update, the DB instance is not restored from the DB snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed. However, if you don't specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, an empty DB instance is created, and the original DB instance is deleted. If you specify a property that is different from the previous snapshot restore property, a new DB instance is restored from the specified ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, and the original DB instance is deleted.
 If you specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property to restore a DB instance (as opposed to specifying it for DB instance updates), then don't specify the following properties:
  +   ``CharacterSetName`` 
  +   ``DBClusterIdentifier`` 
  +   ``DBName`` 
  +   ``DeleteAutomatedBackups`` 
  +   ``EnablePerformanceInsights`` 
  +   ``KmsKeyId`` 
  +   ``MasterUsername`` 
  +   ``MasterUserPassword`` 
  +   ``PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`` 
  +   ``PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod`` 
  +   ``PromotionTier`` 
  +   ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` 
  +   ``SourceRegion`` 
  +   ``StorageEncrypted`` (for an encrypted snapshot)
  +   ``Timezone`` 
  
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. Snapshot restore is managed by the DB cluster.
* **DBSubnetGroupName**: string: A DB subnet group to associate with the DB instance. If you update this value, the new subnet group must be a subnet group in a new VPC. 
 If there's no DB subnet group, then the DB instance isn't a VPC DB instance.
 For more information about using Amazon RDS in a VPC, see [Using Amazon RDS with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*. 
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. The DB subnet group is managed by the DB cluster. If specified, the setting must match the DB cluster setting.
* **DBSystemId**: string (ReadOnly): The Oracle system identifier (SID), which is the name of the Oracle database instance that manages your database files. In this context, the term "Oracle database instance" refers exclusively to the system global area (SGA) and Oracle background processes. If you don't specify a SID, the value defaults to ``RDSCDB``. The Oracle SID is also the name of your CDB.
* **DedicatedLogVolume**: bool: Indicates whether the DB instance has a dedicated log volume (DLV) enabled.
* **DeleteAutomatedBackups**: bool (WriteOnly): A value that indicates whether to remove automated backups immediately after the DB instance is deleted. This parameter isn't case-sensitive. The default is to remove automated backups immediately after the DB instance is deleted.
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. When you delete a DB cluster, all automated backups for that DB cluster are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB cluster snapshots of the DB cluster are not deleted.
* **DeletionProtection**: bool: A value that indicates whether the DB instance has deletion protection enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. By default, deletion protection is disabled. For more information, see [Deleting a DB Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteInstance.html). 
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. You can enable or disable deletion protection for the DB cluster. For more information, see ``CreateDBCluster``. DB instances in a DB cluster can be deleted even when deletion protection is enabled for the DB cluster.
* **Domain**: string: The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in. Currently, only Db2, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB instances can be created in an Active Directory Domain.

 This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances:
  +  Amazon Aurora (The domain is managed by the DB cluster.)
  +  RDS Custom
* **DomainOu**: string: The Active Directory organizational unit for your DB instance to join.
 Constraints:
  +  Must be in the distinguished name format.
  +  Can't be longer than 64 characters.
  
 Example: ``OU=mymanagedADtestOU,DC=mymanagedADtest,DC=mymanagedAD,DC=mydomain``
* **EnableCloudwatchLogsExports**: string[]: The list of log types that need to be enabled for exporting to CloudWatch Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine being used.

* **EngineLifecycleSupport**: string
* **EngineVersion**: string: The version number of the database engine to use.
 For a list of valid engine versions, use the ``DescribeDBEngineVersions`` action.
 The following are the database engines and links to information about the major and minor versions that are available with Amazon RDS. Not every database engine is available for every AWS Region.
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. The version number of the database engine to be used by the DB instance is managed by the DB cluster.
  *Db2* 
 See [Amazon RDS for Db2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Db2.html#Db2.Concepts.VersionMgmt) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* 
  *MariaDB* 
 See [MariaDB on Amazon RDS Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MariaDB.html#MariaDB.Concepts.VersionMgmt) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* 
  *Microsoft SQL Server* 
 See [Microsoft SQL Server Versions on Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.VersionSupport) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* 
  *MySQL* 
 See [MySQL on Amazon RDS Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MySQL.html#MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* 
  *Oracle* 
 See [Oracle Database Engine Release Notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.PatchComposition.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* 
  *PostgreSQL* 
 See [Supported PostgreSQL Database Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.DBVersions) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*
* **Iops**: int: The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the database provisions. The value must be equal to or greater than 1000. 
 If you specify this property, you must follow the range of allowed ratios of your requested IOPS rate to the amount of storage that you allocate (IOPS to allocated storage). For example, you can provision an Oracle database instance with 1000 IOPS and 200 GiB of storage (a ratio of 5:1), or specify 2000 IOPS with 200 GiB of storage (a ratio of 10:1). For more information, see [Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS Storage to Improve Performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/DeveloperGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#USER_PIOPS) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
  If you specify ``io1`` for the ``StorageType`` property, then you must also specify the ``Iops`` property.
  Constraints:
  +  For RDS for Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL - Must be a multiple between .5 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance.
  +  For RDS for SQL Server - Must be a multiple between 1 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance.
* **KmsKeyId**: string: The ARN of the AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt the DB instance, such as ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef``. If you enable the StorageEncrypted property but don't specify this property, AWS CloudFormation uses the default KMS key. If you specify this property, you must set the StorageEncrypted property to true. 
 If you specify the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` or ``SourceDbiResourceId`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB instance, and if the DB instance is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used. However, if the source DB instance is in a different AWS Region, you must specify a KMS key ID.
 If you specify the ``SourceDBInstanceAutomatedBackupsArn`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB instance automated backup, and if the automated backup is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used.
 If you create an encrypted read replica in a different AWS Region, then you must specify a KMS key for the destination AWS Region. KMS encryption keys are specific to the region that they're created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one region in another region.
 If you specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The ``StorageEncrypted`` property value is inherited from the snapshot. If the DB instance is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is also inherited from the snapshot.
 If you specify ``DBSecurityGroups``, AWS CloudFormation ignores this property. To specify both a security group and this property, you must use a VPC security group. For more information about Amazon RDS and VPC, see [Using Amazon RDS with Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. The KMS key identifier is managed by the DB cluster.
* **LicenseModel**: string: License model information for this DB instance.
  Valid Values:
  +  Aurora MySQL - ``general-public-license`` 
  +  Aurora PostgreSQL - ``postgresql-license`` 
  +  RDS for Db2 - ``bring-your-own-license``. For more information about RDS for Db2 licensing, see [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-licensing.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* 
  +  RDS for MariaDB - ``general-public-license`` 
  +  RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - ``license-included`` 
  +  RDS for MySQL - ``general-public-license`` 
  +  RDS for Oracle - ``bring-your-own-license`` or ``license-included`` 
  +  RDS for PostgreSQL - ``postgresql-license`` 
  
  If you've specified ``DBSecurityGroups`` and then you update the license model, AWS CloudFormation replaces the underlying DB instance. This will incur some interruptions to database availability.
* **ManageMasterUserPassword**: bool: Specifies whether to manage the master user password with AWS Secrets Manager.
 For more information, see [Password management with Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

 If ``MonitoringInterval`` is set to a value other than ``0``, then you must supply a ``MonitoringRoleArn`` value.
 This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
* **MultiAZ**: bool: Specifies whether the database instance is a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment. You can't set the ``AvailabilityZone`` parameter if the ``MultiAZ`` parameter is set to true. 
  For more information, see [Multi-AZ deployments for high availability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. Amazon Aurora storage is replicated across all of the Availability Zones and doesn't require the ``MultiAZ`` option to be set.
* **NcharCharacterSetName**: string: The name of the NCHAR character set for the Oracle DB instance.
 This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
* **NetworkType**: string: The network type of the DB instance.
 Valid values:
  +   ``IPV4`` 
  +   ``DUAL`` 
  
 The network type is determined by the ``DBSubnetGroup`` specified for the DB instance. A ``DBSubnetGroup`` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols (``DUAL``).
 For more information, see [Working with a DB instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*
* **OptionGroupName**: string: Indicates that the DB instance should be associated with the specified option group.

* **SourceDBInstanceIdentifier**: string (WriteOnly): If you want to create a read replica DB instance, specify the ID of the source DB instance. Each DB instance can have a limited number of read replicas. For more information, see [Working with Read Replicas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/DeveloperGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
 For information about constraints that apply to DB instance identifiers, see [Naming constraints in Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Limits.html#RDS_Limits.Constraints) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
 The ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property determines whether a DB instance is a read replica. If you remove the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property from your template and then update your stack, AWS CloudFormation promotes the read replica to a standalone DB instance.
 If you specify the ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` or ``RestoreTime`` properties in conjunction with the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property, RDS restores the DB instance to the requested point in time, thereby creating a new DB instance.
   +  If you specify a source DB instance that uses VPC security groups, we recommend that you specify the ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property. If you don't specify the property, the read replica inherits the value of the ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property from the source DB when you create the replica. However, if you update the stack, AWS CloudFormation reverts the replica's ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property to the default value because it's not defined in the stack's template. This change might cause unexpected issues.
  +  Read replicas don't support deletion policies. AWS CloudFormation ignores any deletion policy that's associated with a read replica.
  +  If you specify ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier``, don't specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property. You can't create a read replica from a snapshot.
  +  Don't set the ``BackupRetentionPeriod``, ``DBName``, ``MasterUsername``, ``MasterUserPassword``, and ``PreferredBackupWindow`` properties. The database attributes are inherited from the source DB instance, and backups are disabled for read replicas.
  +  If the source DB instance is in a different region than the read replica, specify the source region in ``SourceRegion``, and specify an ARN for a valid DB instance in ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier``. For more information, see [Constructing a Amazon RDS Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html#USER_Tagging.ARN) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
  +  For DB instances in Amazon Aurora clusters, don't specify this property. Amazon RDS automatically assigns writer and reader DB instances.
* **SourceDbiResourceId**: string (WriteOnly): The resource ID of the source DB instance from which to restore.
* **SourceRegion**: string (WriteOnly): The ID of the region that contains the source DB instance for the read replica.
* **StorageEncrypted**: bool: A value that indicates whether the DB instance is encrypted. By default, it isn't encrypted.
 If you specify the ``KmsKeyId`` property, then you must enable encryption.
 If you specify the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` or ``SourceDbiResourceId`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB instance, and if the DB instance is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used.
 If you specify the ``SourceDBInstanceAutomatedBackupsArn`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB instance automated backup. 
 If you specify ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the snapshot.
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. The encryption for DB instances is managed by the DB cluster.
* **StorageThroughput**: int: Specifies the storage throughput value for the DB instance. This setting applies only to the ``gp3`` storage type. 
 This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora.
* **StorageType**: string: The storage type to associate with the DB instance.
 If you specify ``io1``, ``io2``, or ``gp3``, you must also include a value for the ``Iops`` parameter.
 This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Storage is managed by the DB cluster.
 Valid Values: ``gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard`` 
 Default: ``io1``, if the ``Iops`` parameter is specified. Otherwise, ``gp2``.
* **Tags**: [Tag](#tag)[]: An optional array of key-value pairs to apply to this DB instance.
* **TdeCredentialArn**: string
* **TdeCredentialPassword**: string (WriteOnly)
* **Timezone**: string: The time zone of the DB instance. The time zone parameter is currently supported only by [RDS for Db2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-time-zone) and [RDS for SQL Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.TimeZone).
* **UseDefaultProcessorFeatures**: bool (WriteOnly): Specifies whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its default processor features.
 This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
* **UseLatestRestorableTime**: bool (WriteOnly): Specifies whether the DB instance is restored from the latest backup time. By default, the DB instance isn't restored from the latest backup time.
 Constraints:
  +  Can't be specified if the ``RestoreTime`` parameter is provided.
* **VPCSecurityGroups**: string[]: A list of the VPC security group IDs to assign to the DB instance. The list can include both the physical IDs of existing VPC security groups and references to [AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group.html) resources created in the template.
 If you plan to update the resource, don't specify VPC security groups in a shared VPC.
  If you set ``VPCSecurityGroups``, you must not set [DBSecurityGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsecuritygroups), and vice versa.
  You can migrate a DB instance in your stack from an RDS DB security group to a VPC security group, but keep the following in mind:
  +  You can't revert to using an RDS security group after you establish a VPC security group membership.
  +  When you migrate your DB instance to VPC security groups, if your stack update rolls back because the DB instance update fails or because an update fails in another AWS CloudFormation resource, the rollback fails because it can't revert to an RDS security group.
  +  To use the properties that are available when you use a VPC security group, you must recreate the DB instance. If you don't, AWS CloudFormation submits only the property values that are listed in the [DBSecurityGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsecuritygroups) property.
  
  To avoid this situation, migrate your DB instance to using VPC security groups only when that is the only change in your stack template. 
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. The associated list of EC2 VPC security groups is managed by the DB cluster. If specified, the setting must match the DB cluster setting.
