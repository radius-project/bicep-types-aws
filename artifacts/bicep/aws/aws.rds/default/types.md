By default, write operations are not allowed on Aurora DB clusters that are secondary clusters in an Aurora global database.
 You can set this value only on Aurora DB clusters that are members of an Aurora global database. With this parameter enabled, a secondary cluster can forward writes to the current primary cluster, and the resulting changes are replicated back to this cluster. For the primary DB cluster of an Aurora global database, this value is used immediately if the primary is demoted by a global cluster API operation, but it does nothing until then.
 Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only
* **EnableHttpEndpoint**: bool: Specifies whether to enable the HTTP endpoint for the DB cluster. By default, the HTTP endpoint isn't enabled.
 When enabled, the HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless web service API (RDS Data API) for running SQL queries on the DB cluster. You can also query your database from inside the RDS console with the RDS query editor.
 RDS Data API is supported with the following DB clusters:
  +  Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 and provisioned

 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
* **EngineLifecycleSupport**: string: The life cycle type for this DB cluster.
  By default, this value is set to ``open-source-rds-extended-support``, which enrolls your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by setting the value to ``open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled``. In this case, creating the DB cluster will fail if the DB major version is past its end of standard support date.
  You can use this setting to enroll your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB cluster past the end of standard support for that engine version. For more information, see the following sections:

To see the time blocks available, see [Adjusting the Preferred DB Cluster Maintenance Window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#AdjustingTheMaintenanceWindow.Aurora) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide.* 
 Valid Days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun.
 Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.
 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
* **PubliclyAccessible**: bool: Specifies whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.
 When the DB cluster is publicly accessible and you connect from outside of the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC), its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB cluster, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.
 When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.
 Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only
 Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether ``DBSubnetGroupName`` is specified.
 If ``DBSubnetGroupName`` isn't specified, and ``PubliclyAccessible`` isn't specified, the following applies:
  +  If the default VPC in the target Region doesn?t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
  +  If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public.
  
 If ``DBSubnetGroupName`` is specified, and ``PubliclyAccessible`` isn't specified, the following applies:
  +  If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn?t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
  +  If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public.
* **ReadEndpoint**: [ReadEndpoint](#readendpoint): This data type represents the information you need to connect to an Amazon RDS DB instance. This data type is used as a response element in the following actions:
  +   ``CreateDBInstance`` 
  +   ``DescribeDBInstances`` 
  +   ``DeleteDBInstance`` 
  
 For the data structure that represents Amazon Aurora DB cluster endpoints, see ``DBClusterEndpoint``.
* **ReplicationSourceIdentifier**: string: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source DB instance or DB cluster if this DB cluster is created as a read replica.
 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only
* **RestoreToTime**: string (WriteOnly): The date and time to restore the DB cluster to.
 Valid Values: Value must be a time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) format
 Constraints:
  +  Must be before the latest restorable time for the DB instance
  +  Must be specified if ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` parameter isn't provided
  +  Can't be specified if the ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` parameter is enabled
  +  Can't be specified if the ``RestoreType`` parameter is ``copy-on-write`` 
  
 This property must be used with ``SourceDBClusterIdentifier`` property. The resulting cluster will have the identifier that matches the value of the ``DBclusterIdentifier`` property.
 Example: ``2015-03-07T23:45:00Z`` 
 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
* **RestoreType**: string (WriteOnly): The type of restore to be performed. You can specify one of the following values:
  +   ``full-copy`` - The new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.
  +   ``copy-on-write`` - The new DB cluster is restored as a clone of the source DB cluster.
  
 If you don't specify a ``RestoreType`` value, then the new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.
 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
* **ScalingConfiguration**: [ScalingConfiguration](#scalingconfiguration): The scaling configuration of an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster.
 This property is only supported for Aurora Serverless v1. For Aurora Serverless v2, Use the ``ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration`` property.
 Valid for: Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters only
* **ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration**: [ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration](#serverlessv2scalingconfiguration): The scaling configuration of an Aurora Serverless V2 DB cluster. 
 This property is only supported for Aurora Serverless v2. For Aurora Serverless v1, Use the ``ScalingConfiguration`` property.
 Valid for: Aurora Serverless v2 DB clusters only
* **SnapshotIdentifier**: string (WriteOnly): The identifier for the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot to restore from.
 You can use either the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to specify a DB cluster snapshot. However, you can use only the ARN to specify a DB snapshot.
 After you restore a DB cluster with a ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, you must specify the same ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property for any future updates to the DB cluster. When you specify this property for an update, the DB cluster is not restored from the snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed. However, if you don't specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, an empty DB cluster is created, and the original DB cluster is deleted. If you specify a property that is different from the previous snapshot restore property, a new DB cluster is restored from the specified ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, and the original DB cluster is deleted.
 If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property to restore a DB cluster (as opposed to specifying it for DB cluster updates), then don't specify the following properties:
  +   ``GlobalClusterIdentifier`` 
  +   ``MasterUsername`` 
  +   ``MasterUserPassword`` 
  +   ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` 
  +   ``RestoreType`` 
  +   ``SourceDBClusterIdentifier`` 
  +   ``SourceRegion`` 
  +   ``StorageEncrypted`` (for an encrypted snapshot)
  +   ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` 
  
 Constraints:
  +  Must match the identifier of an existing Snapshot.
  
 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
* **SourceDBClusterIdentifier**: string (WriteOnly): When restoring a DB cluster to a point in time, the identifier of the source DB cluster from which to restore.
 Constraints:
  +  Must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster.
  
 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
* **SourceRegion**: string (WriteOnly): The AWS Region which contains the source DB cluster when replicating a DB cluster. For example, ``us-east-1``. 
 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only
* **StorageEncrypted**: bool: Indicates whether the DB cluster is encrypted.
 If you specify the ``KmsKeyId`` property, then you must enable encryption.
 If you specify the ``SourceDBClusterIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB cluster, and if the DB cluster is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used.
 If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` and the specified snapshot is encrypted, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the snapshot, and the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used.
 If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` and the specified snapshot isn't encrypted, you can use this property to specify that the restored DB cluster is encrypted. Specify the ``KmsKeyId`` property for the KMS key to use for encryption. If you don't want the restored DB cluster to be encrypted, then don't set this property or set it to ``false``.
  If you specify both the ``StorageEncrypted`` and ``SnapshotIdentifier`` properties without specifying the ``KmsKeyId`` property, then the restored DB cluster inherits the encryption settings from the DB snapshot that provide.
  Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
* **StorageThroughput**: int (ReadOnly)
* **StorageType**: string: The storage type to associate with the DB cluster.
 For information on storage types for Aurora DB clusters, see [Storage configurations for Amazon Aurora DB clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.StorageReliability.html#aurora-storage-type).

 Valid Values:
  +  Aurora DB clusters - ``aurora | aurora-iopt1`` 
  +  Multi-AZ DB clusters - ``io1 | io2 | gp3`` 
  
 Default:
  +  Aurora DB clusters - ``aurora`` 
  +  Multi-AZ DB clusters - ``io1`` 
  
  When you create an Aurora DB cluster with the storage type set to ``aurora-iopt1``, the storage type is returned in the response. The storage type isn't returned when you set it to ``aurora``.
* **Tags**: [Tag](#tag)[]: Tags to assign to the DB cluster.
 Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
* **UseLatestRestorableTime**: bool (WriteOnly): A value that indicates whether to restore the DB cluster to the latest restorable backup time. By default, the DB cluster is not restored to the latest restorable backup time. 
 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
* **VpcSecurityGroupIds**: string[]: A list of EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this DB cluster.
 If you plan to update the resource, don't specify VPC security groups in a shared VPC.

The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key in the destination AWS-Region, for example, ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE``.
* **AutomaticBackupReplicationRegion**: string: The AWS-Region associated with the automated backup.
* **AutoMinorVersionUpgrade**: bool: A value that indicates whether minor engine upgrades are applied automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window. By default, minor engine upgrades are applied automatically.
* **AvailabilityZone**: string: The Availability Zone (AZ) where the database will be created. For information on AWS-Regions and Availability Zones, see [Regions and Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html).
 For Amazon Aurora, each Aurora DB cluster hosts copies of its storage in three separate Availability Zones. Specify one of these Availability Zones. Aurora automatically chooses an appropriate Availability Zone if you don't specify one.
 Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's AWS-Region.
 Constraints:
  +  The ``AvailabilityZone`` parameter can't be specified if the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.
  +  The specified Availability Zone must be in the same AWS-Region as the current endpoint.
  
 Example: ``us-east-1d``
* **BackupRetentionPeriod**: int: The number of days for which automated backups are retained. Setting this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables automated backups.

* **CertificateDetails**: [CertificateDetails](#certificatedetails): The details of the DB instance's server certificate.
* **CertificateRotationRestart**: bool (WriteOnly): Specifies whether the DB instance is restarted when you rotate your SSL/TLS certificate.
 By default, the DB instance is restarted when you rotate your SSL/TLS certificate. The certificate is not updated until the DB instance is restarted.
  Set this parameter only if you are *not* using SSL/TLS to connect to the DB instance.
  If you are using SSL/TLS to connect to the DB instance, follow the appropriate instructions for your DB engine to rotate your SSL/TLS certificate:
  +  For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for RDS DB engines, see [Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

* **CustomIAMInstanceProfile**: string: The instance profile associated with the underlying Amazon EC2 instance of an RDS Custom DB instance.
 This setting is required for RDS Custom.
 Constraints:
  +  The profile must exist in your account.
  +  The profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has permissions to assume.
  +  The instance profile name and the associated IAM role name must start with the prefix ``AWSRDSCustom``.
  
 For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see [Configure IAM and your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-setup-orcl.html#custom-setup-orcl.iam-vpc) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
* **DBClusterIdentifier**: string: The identifier of the DB cluster that this DB instance will belong to.

* **DBInstanceIdentifier**: string (Identifier): A name for the DB instance. If you specify a name, AWS CloudFormation converts it to lowercase. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the DB instance. For more information, see [Name Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-name.html).
 For information about constraints that apply to DB instance identifiers, see [Naming constraints in Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Limits.html#RDS_Limits.Constraints) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
  If you specify a name, you can't perform updates that require replacement of this resource. You can perform updates that require no or some interruption. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.
* **DbiResourceId**: string (ReadOnly)
* **DBName**: string: The meaning of this parameter differs according to the database engine you use.
  If you specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, this property only applies to RDS for Oracle.
   *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. The database name is managed by the DB cluster.
  *Db2* 
 The name of the database to create when the DB instance is created. If this parameter isn't specified, no database is created in the DB instance.
 Constraints:
  +  Must contain 1 to 64 letters or numbers.
  +  Must begin with a letter. Subsequent characters can be letters, underscores, or digits (0-9).
  +  Can't be a word reserved by the specified database engine.
  
  *MySQL* 
 The name of the database to create when the DB instance is created. If this parameter is not specified, no database is created in the DB instance.
 Constraints:
  +  Must contain 1 to 64 letters or numbers.
  +  Can't be a word reserved by the specified database engine
  
  *MariaDB* 
 The name of the database to create when the DB instance is created. If this parameter is not specified, no database is created in the DB instance.
 Constraints:
  +  Must contain 1 to 64 letters or numbers.
  +  Can't be a word reserved by the specified database engine
  
  *PostgreSQL* 
 The name of the database to create when the DB instance is created. If this parameter is not specified, the default ``postgres`` database is created in the DB instance.
 Constraints:
  +  Must begin with a letter. Subsequent characters can be letters, underscores, or digits (0-9).
  +  Must contain 1 to 63 characters.
  +  Can't be a word reserved by the specified database engine
  
  *Oracle* 
 The Oracle System ID (SID) of the created DB instance. If you specify ``null``, the default value ``ORCL`` is used. You can't specify the string NULL, or any other reserved word, for ``DBName``. 
 Default: ``ORCL`` 
 Constraints:
  +  Can't be longer than 8 characters
  
  *SQL Server* 
 Not applicable. Must be null.
* **DBParameterGroupName**: string: The name of an existing DB parameter group or a reference to an [AWS::RDS::DBParameterGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-dbparametergroup.html) resource created in the template.
 To list all of the available DB parameter group names, use the following command:
  ``aws rds describe-db-parameter-groups --query "DBParameterGroups[].DBParameterGroupName" --output text`` 
  If any of the data members of the referenced parameter group are changed during an update, the DB instance might need to be restarted, which causes some interruption. If the parameter group contains static parameters, whether they were changed or not, an update triggers a reboot.
  If you don't specify a value for ``DBParameterGroupName`` property, the default DB parameter group for the specified engine and engine version is used.
* **DBSecurityGroups**: string[]: A list of the DB security groups to assign to the DB instance. The list can include both the name of existing DB security groups or references to AWS::RDS::DBSecurityGroup resources created in the template.
  If you set DBSecurityGroups, you must not set VPCSecurityGroups, and vice versa. Also, note that the DBSecurityGroups property exists only for backwards compatibility with older regions and is no longer recommended for providing security information to an RDS DB instance. Instead, use VPCSecurityGroups.
  If you specify this property, AWS CloudFormation sends only the following properties (if specified) to Amazon RDS during create operations:
  +   ``AllocatedStorage`` 
  +   ``AutoMinorVersionUpgrade`` 
  +   ``AvailabilityZone`` 
  +   ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` 
  +   ``CharacterSetName`` 
  +   ``DBInstanceClass`` 
  +   ``DBName`` 
  +   ``DBParameterGroupName`` 
  +   ``DBSecurityGroups`` 
  +   ``DBSubnetGroupName`` 
  +   ``Engine`` 
  +   ``EngineVersion`` 
  +   ``Iops`` 
  +   ``LicenseModel`` 
  +   ``MasterUsername`` 
  +   ``MasterUserPassword`` 
  +   ``MultiAZ`` 
  +   ``OptionGroupName`` 
  +   ``PreferredBackupWindow`` 
  +   ``PreferredMaintenanceWindow`` 
  
 All other properties are ignored. Specify a virtual private cloud (VPC) security group if you want to submit other properties, such as ``StorageType``, ``StorageEncrypted``, or ``KmsKeyId``. If you're already using the ``DBSecurityGroups`` property, you can't use these other properties by updating your DB instance to use a VPC security group. You must recreate the DB instance.
* **DBSnapshotIdentifier**: string (WriteOnly): The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DB snapshot that's used to restore the DB instance. If you're restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, you must specify the ARN of the snapshot.
 By specifying this property, you can create a DB instance from the specified DB snapshot. If the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property is an empty string or the ``AWS::RDS::DBInstance`` declaration has no ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, AWS CloudFormation creates a new database. If the property contains a value (other than an empty string), AWS CloudFormation creates a database from the specified snapshot. If a snapshot with the specified name doesn't exist, AWS CloudFormation can't create the database and it rolls back the stack.
 Some DB instance properties aren't valid when you restore from a snapshot, such as the ``MasterUsername`` and ``MasterUserPassword`` properties. For information about the properties that you can specify, see the ``RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot`` action in the *Amazon RDS API Reference*.
 After you restore a DB instance with a ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, you must specify the same ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property for any future updates to the DB instance. When you specify this property for an update, the DB instance is not restored from the DB snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed. However, if you don't specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, an empty DB instance is created, and the original DB instance is deleted. If you specify a property that is different from the previous snapshot restore property, a new DB instance is restored from the specified ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, and the original DB instance is deleted.
 If you specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property to restore a DB instance (as opposed to specifying it for DB instance updates), then don't specify the following properties:
  +   ``CharacterSetName`` 
  +   ``DBClusterIdentifier`` 
  +   ``DBName`` 
  +   ``KmsKeyId`` 
  +   ``MasterUsername`` 
  +   ``MasterUserPassword`` 
  +   ``PromotionTier`` 
  +   ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` 
  +   ``SourceRegion`` 
  +   ``StorageEncrypted`` (for an unencrypted snapshot)
  +   ``Timezone`` 
  
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. Snapshot restore is managed by the DB cluster.
* **DBSubnetGroupName**: string: A DB subnet group to associate with the DB instance. If you update this value, the new subnet group must be a subnet group in a new VPC. 
 If there's no DB subnet group, then the DB instance isn't a VPC DB instance.
 For more information about using Amazon RDS in a VPC, see [Amazon VPC and Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*. 
 This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The DB subnet group is managed by the DB cluster. If specified, the setting must match the DB cluster setting.
* **DBSystemId**: string (ReadOnly): The Oracle system identifier (SID), which is the name of the Oracle database instance that manages your database files. In this context, the term "Oracle database instance" refers exclusively to the system global area (SGA) and Oracle background processes. If you don't specify a SID, the value defaults to ``RDSCDB``. The Oracle SID is also the name of your CDB.
* **DedicatedLogVolume**: bool: Indicates whether the DB instance has a dedicated log volume (DLV) enabled.
* **DeleteAutomatedBackups**: bool (WriteOnly): A value that indicates whether to remove automated backups immediately after the DB instance is deleted. This parameter isn't case-sensitive. The default is to remove automated backups immediately after the DB instance is deleted.
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. When you delete a DB cluster, all automated backups for that DB cluster are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB cluster snapshots of the DB cluster are not deleted.
* **DeletionProtection**: bool: Specifies whether the DB instance has deletion protection enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For more information, see [Deleting a DB Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteInstance.html).
 This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. You can enable or disable deletion protection for the DB cluster. For more information, see ``CreateDBCluster``. DB instances in a DB cluster can be deleted even when deletion protection is enabled for the DB cluster.
* **Domain**: string: The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in. Currently, only Db2, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB instances can be created in an Active Directory Domain.

 This property is required when creating a DB instance.
  You can convert an Oracle database from the non-CDB architecture to the container database (CDB) architecture by updating the ``Engine`` value in your templates from ``oracle-ee`` to ``oracle-ee-cdb`` or from ``oracle-se2`` to ``oracle-se2-cdb``. Converting to the CDB architecture requires an interruption.
  Valid Values:
  +   ``aurora-mysql`` (for Aurora MySQL DB instances)
  +   ``aurora-postgresql`` (for Aurora PostgreSQL DB instances)
  +   ``custom-oracle-ee`` (for RDS Custom for Oracle DB instances)
  +   ``custom-oracle-ee-cdb`` (for RDS Custom for Oracle DB instances)

  +   ``sqlserver-se`` 
  +   ``sqlserver-ex`` 
  +   ``sqlserver-web``
* **EngineLifecycleSupport**: string: The life cycle type for this DB instance.
  By default, this value is set to ``open-source-rds-extended-support``, which enrolls your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by setting the value to ``open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled``. In this case, creating the DB instance will fail if the DB major version is past its end of standard support date.
  This setting applies only to RDS for MySQL and RDS for PostgreSQL. For Amazon Aurora DB instances, the life cycle type is managed by the DB cluster.
 You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB instance past the end of standard support for that engine version. For more information, see [Using Amazon RDS Extended Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/extended-support.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
 Valid Values: ``open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled`` 
 Default: ``open-source-rds-extended-support``
* **EngineVersion**: string: The version number of the database engine to use.
 For a list of valid engine versions, use the ``DescribeDBEngineVersions`` action.
 The following are the database engines and links to information about the major and minor versions that are available with Amazon RDS. Not every database engine is available for every AWS Region.
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. The version number of the database engine to be used by the DB instance is managed by the DB cluster.
  *Db2* 
 See [Amazon RDS for Db2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Db2.html#Db2.Concepts.VersionMgmt) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* 
  *MariaDB* 
 See [MariaDB on Amazon RDS Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MariaDB.html#MariaDB.Concepts.VersionMgmt) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* 
  *Microsoft SQL Server* 
 See [Microsoft SQL Server Versions on Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.VersionSupport) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* 
  *MySQL* 
 See [MySQL on Amazon RDS Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MySQL.html#MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* 
  *Oracle* 
 See [Oracle Database Engine Release Notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.PatchComposition.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* 
  *PostgreSQL* 
 See [Supported PostgreSQL Database Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.DBVersions) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*
* **Iops**: int: The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the database provisions. The value must be equal to or greater than 1000. 
 If you specify this property, you must follow the range of allowed ratios of your requested IOPS rate to the amount of storage that you allocate (IOPS to allocated storage). For example, you can provision an Oracle database instance with 1000 IOPS and 200 GiB of storage (a ratio of 5:1), or specify 2000 IOPS with 200 GiB of storage (a ratio of 10:1). For more information, see [Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS Storage to Improve Performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/DeveloperGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#USER_PIOPS) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
  If you specify ``io1`` for the ``StorageType`` property, then you must also specify the ``Iops`` property.
  Constraints:
  +  For RDS for Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL - Must be a multiple between .5 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance.
  +  For RDS for SQL Server - Must be a multiple between 1 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance.
* **KmsKeyId**: string: The ARN of the AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt the DB instance, such as ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef``. If you enable the StorageEncrypted property but don't specify this property, AWS CloudFormation uses the default KMS key. If you specify this property, you must set the StorageEncrypted property to true. 
 If you specify the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` or ``SourceDbiResourceId`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB instance, and if the DB instance is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used. However, if the source DB instance is in a different AWS Region, you must specify a KMS key ID.
 If you specify the ``SourceDBInstanceAutomatedBackupsArn`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB instance automated backup, and if the automated backup is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used.
 If you create an encrypted read replica in a different AWS Region, then you must specify a KMS key for the destination AWS Region. KMS encryption keys are specific to the region that they're created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one region in another region.
 If you specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The ``StorageEncrypted`` property value is inherited from the snapshot. If the DB instance is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is also inherited from the snapshot.
 If you specify ``DBSecurityGroups``, AWS CloudFormation ignores this property. To specify both a security group and this property, you must use a VPC security group. For more information about Amazon RDS and VPC, see [Using Amazon RDS with Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. The KMS key identifier is managed by the DB cluster.
* **LicenseModel**: string: License model information for this DB instance.
  Valid Values:
  +  Aurora MySQL - ``general-public-license`` 
  +  Aurora PostgreSQL - ``postgresql-license`` 
  +  RDS for Db2 - ``bring-your-own-license``. For more information about RDS for Db2 licensing, see [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-licensing.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* 
  +  RDS for MariaDB - ``general-public-license`` 
  +  RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - ``license-included`` 
  +  RDS for MySQL - ``general-public-license`` 
  +  RDS for Oracle - ``bring-your-own-license`` or ``license-included`` 
  +  RDS for PostgreSQL - ``postgresql-license`` 
  
  If you've specified ``DBSecurityGroups`` and then you update the license model, AWS CloudFormation replaces the underlying DB instance. This will incur some interruptions to database availability.
* **ManageMasterUserPassword**: bool: Specifies whether to manage the master user password with AWS Secrets Manager.
 For more information, see [Password management with Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

 For more information, see [Password management with Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*
* **MaxAllocatedStorage**: int: The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automatically scale the storage of the DB instance.
 For more information about this setting, including limitations that apply to it, see [Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
 This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances:
  +  Amazon Aurora (Storage is managed by the DB cluster.)
  +  RDS Custom
* **MonitoringInterval**: int: The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collection of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify ``0``.
 If ``MonitoringRoleArn`` is specified, then you must set ``MonitoringInterval`` to a value other than ``0``.
 This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
 Valid Values: ``0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 60`` 
 Default: ``0``
* **MonitoringRoleArn**: string: The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example, ``arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess``.

* **NetworkType**: string: The network type of the DB instance.
 Valid values:
  +   ``IPV4`` 
  +   ``DUAL`` 
  
 The network type is determined by the ``DBSubnetGroup`` specified for the DB instance. A ``DBSubnetGroup`` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols (``DUAL``).
 For more information, see [Working with a DB instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*
* **OptionGroupName**: string: Indicates that the DB instance should be associated with the specified option group.
 Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, can't be removed from an option group. Also, that option group can't be removed from a DB instance once it is associated with a DB instance.
* **PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId**: string: The AWS KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data.
 The KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.
 If you do not specify a value for ``PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId``, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your AWS account. Your AWS account has a different default KMS key for each AWS Region.
 For information about enabling Performance Insights, see [EnablePerformanceInsights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-enableperformanceinsights).
* **PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod**: int: The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.
 This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
 Valid Values:
  +   ``7`` 
  +   *month* * 31, where *month* is a number of months from 1-23. Examples: ``93`` (3 months * 31), ``341`` (11 months * 31), ``589`` (19 months * 31)
  +   ``731`` 
  
 Default: ``7`` days
 If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as ``94``, Amazon RDS returns an error.
* **Port**: string: The port number on which the database accepts connections.
 This setting doesn't apply to Aurora DB instances. The port number is managed by the cluster.
 Valid Values: ``1150-65535`` 
 Default:

  +  Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
  +  Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window.
  +  Must be at least 30 minutes.
  
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. The daily time range for creating automated backups is managed by the DB cluster.
* **PreferredMaintenanceWindow**: string: The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
 Format: ``ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi`` 
 The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region, occurring on a random day of the week. To see the time blocks available, see [Adjusting the Preferred DB Instance Maintenance Window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#AdjustingTheMaintenanceWindow) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* 
  This property applies when AWS CloudFormation initially creates the DB instance. If you use AWS CloudFormation to update the DB instance, those updates are applied immediately.
  Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.

 This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
 Default: ``1`` 
 Valid Values: ``0 - 15``
* **PubliclyAccessible**: bool: Indicates whether the DB instance is an internet-facing instance. If you specify true, AWS CloudFormation creates an instance with a publicly resolvable DNS name, which resolves to a public IP address. If you specify false, AWS CloudFormation creates an internal instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. 
 The default behavior value depends on your VPC setup and the database subnet group. For more information, see the ``PubliclyAccessible`` parameter in the [CreateDBInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBInstance.html) in the *Amazon RDS API Reference*.
* **ReplicaMode**: string: The open mode of an Oracle read replica. For more information, see [Working with Oracle Read Replicas for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
 This setting is only supported in RDS for Oracle.
 Default: ``open-read-only`` 
 Valid Values: ``open-read-only`` or ``mounted``
* **RestoreTime**: string (WriteOnly): The date and time to restore from. This parameter applies to point-in-time recovery. For more information, see [Restoring a DB instance to a specified time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIT.html) in the in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
 Constraints:
  +  Must be a time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) format.
  +  Must be before the latest restorable time for the DB instance.
  +  Can't be specified if the ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` parameter is enabled.
  
 Example: ``2009-09-07T23:45:00Z``
* **SourceDBClusterIdentifier**: string: The identifier of the Multi-AZ DB cluster that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB cluster can have up to 15 read replicas.
 Constraints:
  +  Must be the identifier of an existing Multi-AZ DB cluster.
  +  Can't be specified if the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` parameter is also specified.
  +  The specified DB cluster must have automatic backups enabled, that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.
  +  The source DB cluster must be in the same AWS-Region as the read replica. Cross-Region replication isn't supported.
* **SourceDBInstanceAutomatedBackupsArn**: string (WriteOnly): The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replicated automated backups from which to restore, for example, ``arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:auto-backup:ab-L2IJCEXJP7XQ7HOJ4SIEXAMPLE``.
 This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
* **SourceDBInstanceIdentifier**: string (WriteOnly): If you want to create a read replica DB instance, specify the ID of the source DB instance. Each DB instance can have a limited number of read replicas. For more information, see [Working with Read Replicas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/DeveloperGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
 For information about constraints that apply to DB instance identifiers, see [Naming constraints in Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Limits.html#RDS_Limits.Constraints) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
 The ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property determines whether a DB instance is a read replica. If you remove the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property from your template and then update your stack, AWS CloudFormation promotes the read replica to a standalone DB instance.
 If you specify the ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` or ``RestoreTime`` properties in conjunction with the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property, RDS restores the DB instance to the requested point in time, thereby creating a new DB instance.
   +  If you specify a source DB instance that uses VPC security groups, we recommend that you specify the ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property. If you don't specify the property, the read replica inherits the value of the ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property from the source DB when you create the replica. However, if you update the stack, AWS CloudFormation reverts the replica's ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property to the default value because it's not defined in the stack's template. This change might cause unexpected issues.
  +  Read replicas don't support deletion policies. AWS CloudFormation ignores any deletion policy that's associated with a read replica.
  +  If you specify ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier``, don't specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property. You can't create a read replica from a snapshot.
  +  Don't set the ``BackupRetentionPeriod``, ``DBName``, ``MasterUsername``, ``MasterUserPassword``, and ``PreferredBackupWindow`` properties. The database attributes are inherited from the source DB instance, and backups are disabled for read replicas.
  +  If the source DB instance is in a different region than the read replica, specify the source region in ``SourceRegion``, and specify an ARN for a valid DB instance in ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier``. For more information, see [Constructing a Amazon RDS Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html#USER_Tagging.ARN) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
  +  For DB instances in Amazon Aurora clusters, don't specify this property. Amazon RDS automatically assigns writer and reader DB instances.
* **SourceDbiResourceId**: string (WriteOnly): The resource ID of the source DB instance from which to restore.
* **SourceRegion**: string (WriteOnly): The ID of the region that contains the source DB instance for the read replica.
* **StorageEncrypted**: bool: A value that indicates whether the DB instance is encrypted. By default, it isn't encrypted.
 If you specify the ``KmsKeyId`` property, then you must enable encryption.
 If you specify the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` or ``SourceDbiResourceId`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB instance, and if the DB instance is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used.
 If you specify the ``SourceDBInstanceAutomatedBackupsArn`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB instance automated backup. 
 If you specify ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the snapshot.
  *Amazon Aurora* 
 Not applicable. The encryption for DB instances is managed by the DB cluster.
* **StorageThroughput**: int: Specifies the storage throughput value for the DB instance. This setting applies only to the ``gp3`` storage type. 
 This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora.
* **StorageType**: string: The storage type to associate with the DB instance.
 If you specify ``io1``, ``io2``, or ``gp3``, you must also include a value for the ``Iops`` parameter.
 This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Storage is managed by the DB cluster.
 Valid Values: ``gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard`` 
 Default: ``io1``, if the ``Iops`` parameter is specified. Otherwise, ``gp2``.
* **Tags**: [Tag](#tag)[]: Tags to assign to the DB instance.
* **TdeCredentialArn**: string
* **TdeCredentialPassword**: string (WriteOnly)
* **Timezone**: string: The time zone of the DB instance. The time zone parameter is currently supported only by [RDS for Db2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-time-zone) and [RDS for SQL Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.TimeZone).
* **UseDefaultProcessorFeatures**: bool (WriteOnly): Specifies whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its default processor features.
 This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
* **UseLatestRestorableTime**: bool (WriteOnly): Specifies whether the DB instance is restored from the latest backup time. By default, the DB instance isn't restored from the latest backup time. This parameter applies to point-in-time recovery. For more information, see [Restoring a DB instance to a specified time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIT.html) in the in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
 Constraints:
  +  Can't be specified if the ``RestoreTime`` parameter is provided.
* **VPCSecurityGroups**: string[]: A list of the VPC security group IDs to assign to the DB instance. The list can include both the physical IDs of existing VPC security groups and references to [AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group.html) resources created in the template.
 If you plan to update the resource, don't specify VPC security groups in a shared VPC.
  If you set ``VPCSecurityGroups``, you must not set [DBSecurityGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsecuritygroups), and vice versa.
  You can migrate a DB instance in your stack from an RDS DB security group to a VPC security group, but keep the following in mind:
  +  You can't revert to using an RDS security group after you establish a VPC security group membership.
  +  When you migrate your DB instance to VPC security groups, if your stack update rolls back because the DB instance update fails or because an update fails in another AWS CloudFormation resource, the rollback fails because it can't revert to an RDS security group.
  +  To use the properties that are available when you use a VPC security group, you must recreate the DB instance. If you don't, AWS CloudFormation submits only the property values that are listed in the [DBSecurityGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsecuritygroups) property.
  
  To avoid this situation, migrate your DB instance to using VPC security groups only when that is the only change in your stack template.
